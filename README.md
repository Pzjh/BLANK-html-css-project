# BLANK. Restaurant Website


## User Experience

---

### User Goals.

The user should be able to find an updated menu, a gallery of relevant pictures showing the interior, menu items and events.  
The user should also be able to easily make a reservation through the booking page.

The sites goal is to bring customers in and make it easy for them to find information or make a reservation.  
This applies to **all** users no matter if they are new visitors or recurring users.

### Design

* Typography  
    * The fonts used for this site is Raleway and Anton with Raleway being the standard font  
    for the whole website. Sans-serif was put as the fallback font in case the others couldn't  
    be used.  

* Images  
    * Images are used in the header and in the gallery to provide the user with a taste of what the restaurant has to offer.  

* Color  
    * The colors used.

## Features

### Todays Features

* The website features a Home page that presents the user with information about the restaurant and a gallery  
with pictures from the restaurant to give the user an idea of what to expect.
* The Navigation bar gives the user easy access to all of the sites pages.
* The Menu page shows the user what is currently on the Menu.
* The Booking page contains a form in wich the user can make a reservation.
* The footer gives the user easy access to all of the restaurants social media accounts.

### Coming Updates

* In coming updates we are looking to add a calendar function in the booking page which will let the user  
see when a reservation is possible and and if the restaurant is fully booked on any dates and times.

* There is also an idea about expanding the Gallery to be its own page.

* If the restaurants customers show an interest in the restaurants farm a page detailing how we work with  
creating our ingredients might also be created.
